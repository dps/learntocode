# Lesson 1: part 1

`Code` is like a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Imagine you are giving a recipe to a robot to make cookies. The recipe would be the code and the robot would be the computer.

Let's look at some python code.
```
1 + 3
```
Does that look familiar? Yes - math _expressions_ are one of the ways you can give instructions to the computer in python code.

One way that you can get the computer to follow python code instructions is to type them in one at a time.

Run `python` in the Shell - you'll see something like this if it's working right:
```
~/learntocode$ python
Python 3.10.8 (main, Oct 11 2022, 11:35:05) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

Now try typing in some math like `1 + 3` then press [return].
> What did you see? What do you expect to see if you type `4 * 4`?

Have some fun trying other math _expressions_
