# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

Welcome to your first lesson in Python! Python is a programming language that is used to create all kinds of computer programs, from simple games to complex software. In this lesson, we're going to learn the basics of Python by looking at some code and understanding what it does.

There are many programming languages out there. They all make it possible for a person to write a very detailed set of instructions which the computer will follow to accomplish a task. Each language looks a little different written down, but they all do essentially the same thing. Some other popular languages include C, Java, Javascript, Go, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Kotlin and Lisp but we will be learning python. It's an easy language to learn but also extremely powerful and is used by real professional programmers all around the world to do a lot of cutting edge stuff. It's not a toy language - it's the real thing and at the end of this course you'll be able to solve difficult problems and be ready to start writing a computer game in python!

We're using replit.com for this tutorial which means you can get back to your lessons on any computer with a web browser. Before we get started, Daddy will explain the replit user interface. Ask Daddy to show you:

* Files - what are they and how do you create a new one?
* The "Shell" - what is it and how do you run a python program in the shell?
