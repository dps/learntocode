# Lesson 1 - part 3

```
>>> 3 + 1
4
```

Let's take a closer look at that math we did just now. `3` and `1` are numbers - numbers are just one kind of *data* that python can handle. The technical name for a kind of data in programming is its `type` We're soon going to learn about some other _types_ of data that python can handle. Remember that word `type` though - it's a special word in programming.

## Integers

In fact `3`, `1` and `4` are a particular type of number called an integer or `int` in python. Integers are whole numbers - 1,2,3,4 etc. Python can handle another kind of number too.
> Can you think what that other kind of number might be?
